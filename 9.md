M9: System Documentation

Your final milestone is to complete the documentation of your system. Your documentation will describe your RPC interface and the internal structure of your operating system well enough that another student in your class could take the project over at this stage and debug or extend your system.

    M9: System Documentation
    Hints
    Submission

Be sure to point out any known limitations in your system, or any important assumptions you have made.

You also have a chance to clean up your codebase, so that it's readable by someone other than you.

At the very least you should document:

    page-table structure,
    system call dispatching,
    I/O subsystem, and
    process management.

If you completed any bonus features be sure to document them as well.
Hints

    Use LaTeX.
    Use diagrams.
    Use a spell-checker.
    Read Gernot's style guide.

Submission

For this milestone you are required to your documentation in pdf form, as well as your entire code base, as described in the project outline.
