M6: Demand paging

In this milestone you need to implement paging of memory. This should build on the earlier milestone where you implemented a pager. The backing store for your paging system will be an NFS file called swap. You should implement a second-chance page-replacement algorithm.

Design issues

Most of the design in this section will come down to the appropriate choice of data structures. If you haven't already done so, you will need to work out your page table structure. You will also need to decide how to keep track of frames in your paging file. You may want to keep things simple at first by only concentrating on one process, however you should be aware that the next milestone will require you to handle multiple processes.
Assessment

To demonstrate that your code is indeed using the paging system you should artificially reduce the number of free frames, and run a program which uses a large heap.

Note: Choose a large difference between RAM and the paging file size, (e.g. at least 10 times the reduced RAM) to ensure you can clearly demonstrate paging extending the available memory to run applications larger than available RAM.

You may want to write a command called thrash which writes data to a given number of pages and then reads it back (verifying that it has been read back correctly).
